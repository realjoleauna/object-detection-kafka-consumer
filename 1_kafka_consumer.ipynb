    "# Kafka Consumer Example - Printing Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "For an introduction to [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), you may want to read some of the main [concepts](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_concepts_and_terms).  An **event** records the fact that \"something happened\". An event has a key, value, timestamp, and optional metadata headers. **Producers** are those client applications that publish (write) events to Kafka, and **consumers** are those that subscribe to (read and process) these events.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of how to write a very simple Kafka [consumer](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaConsumer.html) using the kafka-python library.  This example connects to a Kafka broker configured with the `SASL_PLAIN` security protocol. It receives simple JSON formatted strings on a kafka **topic** and prints them out to the console.  This is a single consumer, but could be part of a **consumer group**. A consumer group is a set of consumers which cooperate to consume data from some topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sample producer, refer to the notebook [1_kafka_producer.ipynb](./1_kafka_producer.ipynb) to send some sample events.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading, visit the [documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) for Kafka and for [kafka-python](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/)\n"
